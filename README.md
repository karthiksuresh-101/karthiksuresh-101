## Hi there 👋

### I'm Karthik

A curious Data Analytics & AI enthusiast with a background in Electronics & Communication Engineering.
I'm currently building skills across Excel, SQL, Python, Tableau/Power BI, and strengthening my understanding of business fundamentals to become a strong industry-ready data analyst. I enjoy learning things from scratch, documenting them, and turning everything I learn into practical, real-world projects.

###  What I'm Currently Working On

I’m currently focused on building and upskilling myself to be a job-ready data analyst by consistently building real-world portfolio projects and documenting my progress through a study series on LinkedIn. Step by step, I’m also expanding my skills toward data forecasting and finance analytics as part of my long-term growth path.

###  Tools & Skills I Use

I work with Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau/Power BI to clean, explore, analyze, and visualize data. I’m comfortable with tasks like Excel dashboards, SQL joins and window functions, and Python-based exploratory analysis using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Alongside this, I’m learning the foundations of machine learning, business analytics, and automation. My background in Electronics and Communication Engineering gives me strong logical and critical thinking, analytical ability, and a problem-solving mindset that I bring into every project.
